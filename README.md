# Banking Demo with EF Core :bank:

This repository contains the example project demonstrated in the EF Core session for the PÃ“S TECH audience at FIAP. 
This simple banking application showcases the use of EF Core in a .NET 8 environment for handling banking operations like credit and debit transactions using PIX keys. 
The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate various EF Core features and best practices.

## Getting Started :checkered_flag:

What you'll need:

- .NET 8 SDK
- Docker :whale:

## Features Demonstrated :building_construction:

- Grouping [EF Core's configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/#grouping-configuration) `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` to map complex domains into database tables.
- Implementing [Shadow Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/shadow-properties) for database-specific requirements that do not directly map to the domain.
- Mapping value objects and enumeration classes to primitive data columns using [EF Core converters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/value-conversions?tabs=data-annotations).
- Using [EF Core Interceptors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors) to modify control properties in the database.
- Creating an `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` with [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) to ensure commands are executed within a database transaction.
- Techniques for [querying](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/shadow-properties#accessing-shadow-properties) Shadow Properties.
- Integrating EF Core with [Testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet) library to create robust integration tests with independent databases without altering the EF Core Database Provider.
